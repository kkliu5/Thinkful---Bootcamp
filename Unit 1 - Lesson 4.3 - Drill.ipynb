    "# You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.\n",
    "* Seasonality bias. Since the emails are tested in different months, there is potential for people to be more willing to buy a bathing suit in May compared to February since it will be the summer time. Instead should sample an entire year or similar/ multiple months.\n",

    "# You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.\n",
    "* Sampling bias. Since people coming in are voluntarily coming in (since they believe they might have anxiety) that is not a true representation of the general population. Can sample people at a different location that better reflects the general population. \n",

    "# You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.\n",
    "* Assuming that there are no other marketing campaigns or other leads that would attract customers, there could potentially be bias if one is comparing against a week that have unusually low website visits.\n",

    "# You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.\n",
    "* Assuming that the there is no external factor that would decrease the number of visits, there could be bias if the loyalty program is not marketed and customers are unaware."
